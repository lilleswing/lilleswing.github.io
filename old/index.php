                        Hi! My name is <b>Karl Leswing</b> and this is my homepage.  I am interested in all things technology from embedded systems to MVC frameworks.  I particularly enjoy the fields of Wireless Sensor Networks, Cloud Computing, Signals Processing and Machine Learning/Data Mining.  I believe that the only way to do something right, is to do it at least two or three times.
