						<h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>
                        In addition to the programming related hobbies on the side bar I am an amatuer bowler with an average of around 202, and am looking to join an adult frisbee and lacrosse league. <br><br>
                        I am also interested in craft beers from around America and the world.  You can see a spreadsheet of all the beers I have tried <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgeEv0ykxO6WdFFZaUpnYTdHaTRNNVhDWGxnY3kxZ0E">here</a>.
