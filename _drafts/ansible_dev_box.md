title: Newest ML Hardware Build
---

Welcoming abra the newest ML dev box. [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/lilleswing/saved/tPFkLk).  I'm a bit worried that the i5 will not be able to keep up with the 1080ti.  In theory all the cpu has to do is shuttle data from disk -> ram -> gpu if our algorithms are optimized correctly. Most of the data I can find on the GPU is based on playing games and not for machine learning.
