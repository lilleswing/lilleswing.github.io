I am a tech lead at [Schrödinger](https://www.schrodinger.com) working on machine learning research and development. In this role am one of the Schrödinger members of the [Columbia Center for Computational Electrochemistry](https://ccce.chem.columbia.edu/), a group dedicated to computational research to discover next generation electrochemical technologies.

In 2017 I was a visiting researcher at the [Pande Lab](https://pande.stanford.edu/) working on using deep learning techniques for drug discovery.  During that time we posted [MoleculeNet](http://moleculenet.ai/) a benchmarking paper analyzing machine learning techniques for chemoinformatics.
