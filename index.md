I am a tech lead at
[Schr√∂dinger](https://www.schrodinger.com)
working on machine learning research and [LiveDesign](http://www.schrodinger.com/livedesign).

LiveDesign is a plugable collaboration environment for computational science, which enables medicinal chemists push button access to the best chemical models.

Recently I was a visiting researcher at the [Pande Lab](https://pande.stanford.edu/) working on using deep learning techniques for drug discovery.  During that time we posted [MoleculeNet](http://moleculenet.ai/) a benchmarking paper analyzing machine learning techniques for chemoinformatics.
