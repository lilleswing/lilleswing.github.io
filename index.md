I am a tech lead at
[Schr√∂dinger]("https://www.schrodinger.com")
working on machine learning research and [Livedesign]("http://www.schrodinger.com/livedesign").

Livedesign is a plugable collaboration environment for computational science, which enables medicinal chemists push button access to the best chemical models.

Recently I was a visiting researcher at the [Pande Lab]("https://pande.stanford.edu/") working on using deep learning techniques for drug discovery.  During that time we posted [MoleculeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564) a benchmarking paper analyzing machine learning techniques for chemoinformatics.
