Since high school I have been bad at the board game [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

In set there are 81 cards and each card has four attributes.

1. Number [1,2,3]
2. Shape [oval, diamond, squiggle]
3. Color [red, green, purple]
4. Shading [solid, lined, outlined]

The goal of the game is to collect bags of three cards where each attribute either has all of one type, or one of each.

In order to get better I made a simple matching game -- the goal is to select the card which finishes the set for two given query cards.

It times how long it takes to make 20 matches.
