title: Oracle of Bacon

I volunteer for [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/) teaching high school computer science.
For the student's final project this year they had to make a website using a web based API.
They then had to make a slide deck and pitch their website as if it were an app.

I made a sample solution alongside the students using the Giphy API calculating Bacon Paths.

You can see it live [here](https://lilleswing.github.io/six_degrees_of_bacon/).
