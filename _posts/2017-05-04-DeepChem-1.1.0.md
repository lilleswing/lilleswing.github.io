[DeepChem 1.1.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/releases/tag/1.1.0)

Over the past three months I have been working on [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) at the [Pande Lab](https://pande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford. During that time I developed TensorGraph, a new Deep Learning model framework inspired by Keras. TensorGraph models networks as DAGs of computation. This makes it easier to create complex non linear network topologies. Current models of [MoleculeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564) are being ported over into the new
framework.

For the next release we are targeting
* Increased image support
* Example reinforcement learning implementations ([A3C](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-8-asynchronous-actor-critic-agents-a3c-c88f72a5e9f2))
* [GAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) support

It is a very exciting time to be doing machine learning research in drug discovery. Check out the work on [github](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) or just download the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/deepchemio/deepchem/).
