title: Book Chapter on Active Learning FEP
---

I recently helped out on writing a book chapter on effective protocols for applying active learning to Free Energy 
Calculations.

## Abstract
Binding free energy predictions of small molecules are becoming increasingly impactful in drug discovery campaigns. By
efficiently and reliably identifying potent and selective chemical matter, project teams can invest time and financial
resources on the most promising design ideas and effectively explore the most relevant chemical space. A large pool of
design ideas along with sufficient accuracy and throughput are all required for binding free energy predictions to
accelerate drug discovery programs. In this chapter, we discuss how free energy calculations are being used at scale in
our internal drug discovery teams and collaborations to positively impact project performance, and we highlight our
experience with and best practices that are emerging for active learning FEP (AL-FEP), an approach that combines
large-scale library enumerations, machine learning strategies, and free energy calculations to efficiently explore
diverse chemical space.
